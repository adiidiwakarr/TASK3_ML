##DESCRIPTION:
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a complete pipeline for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes:

Data Preprocessing: Loads CIFAR-10, normalizes pixel values, and applies one-hot encoding to labels.

Model Building: Constructs a CNN using Keras with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.

Training: Compiles the model with Adam optimizer and trains for 10 epochs with validation split.

Evaluation: Tests the model on the test dataset, achieving approximately 69.63% accuracy.

Visualization: Plots training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.
